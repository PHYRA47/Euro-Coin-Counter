# 🪙 Euro Coin Counting Project 📸

Welcome to the Euro Coin Counting Project! This project represents the final assignment for the Digital Image Processing and Analysis course during the first semester of the [PSRS 2023](https://www.master-photonics4security.eu/psrs-in-2023-2025) program in collaboration with [Nadeer Hasan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadeer-hasan-329698211/). The primary aim is to employ digital image processing techniques to identify, classify, and count Euro coins from a given image.

### Project Overview

The Euro Coin Counting Project involves several key steps:

1. **Image Loading and Preprocessing 🖼️**

2. **Watershed Segmentation 💧**

3. **Connected Component Labeling 🏷️**

4. **Coin Classification and Counting 💰**
  
5. **Visualization 📊**
